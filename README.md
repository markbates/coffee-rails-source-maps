# CoffeeScript Rails Source Maps

#### Please note this project is no longer actively maintained.

Adds CoffeeScript source maps support, introduced in version [1.6.1](http://coffeescript.org/#changelog), to Rails. This code is based on a Gist by [naan](https://gist.github.com/naan/5096056).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'coffee-rails-source-maps'

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    $ rm -rf tmp/cache/assets

Removing `tmp/cache/assets` will cause the asset pipeline to recompile all your coffeescripts on the next page load. This will ensure all source maps are generated.

## Usage

This gem should really only be used in development mode.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'coffee-rails-source-maps'
end
```

This gem will create a folder called `assets/source_maps` in the Rails `public` directory. I would recommend adding this to your `.gitignore` file so you don't check this folder into git.

```
public/assets/source_maps/
```

### Using Source Maps in Chrome

In order to use the source maps you need to use a browser that supports them. Chrome is an excellent choice.

First Enable Developer Tools Experiments, chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments

Open the Chrome console and click on the settings tab. You'll see an option to enable source maps, make sure that is checked.

### Activating the Map

Finally to see your CoffeeScript code in the Chrome console just add a `debugger` call in your code and you'll see the CoffeeScript in your console to debug.

## Help! I'm Not Seeing Maps!

Make sure you've deleted `tmp/cache/assets`, restarted your server, enabled source maps in Chrome, and cleared its cache.

Good luck!
